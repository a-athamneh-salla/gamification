This Gantt chart outlines the implementation timeline for the three phases defined in the PRD:

1. **Phase 1: MVP** - Focuses on implementing the core logic engine, event integration, reward system, and the basic UI component for merchants.
2. **Phase 2: Admin Panel & Analytics** - Introduces admin configurations for tasks, missions, rules, and rewards, along with analytics dashboards for tracking merchant progress.
3. **Phase 3: Gamified Enhancements** - Adds advanced gamification features like badges, tiers, leaderboards, and seasonal campaigns to enhance merchant engagement.
